#1. The architecture used in this project is MVC.

#2. The libraries I used are:
 - "get" for state management.
 - "url_launcher" to open WhatsApp and email.
 - "http" to consume APIs from endpoints.

#3 It took around 20 hours, with 8 hours of work per day.

#4 If I have additional time, I will add a feature to sort the data based on type, so the data display will not be random and more visually appealing. Perhaps adding a floating header feature would also be nice, so when users scroll down to read an article, they can still see the header title of the blog.

#5 The part where we press the email and are directed straight to the email application with the placeholder "Hi i am MK company".

#6 Features on the home screen include displaying random data, data search, and handling errors.

#7 I think this is a very good test. Besides testing how we display data from APIs, it also sharpens our logic due to the requirements that need to be met. If I may add, having a requirement to design, such as displaying a list of blogs in a view, would be more challenging.

#8 This is a difficult question to answer. Sometimes, if we pursue quantity, quality has to be sacrificed, and vice versa. However, I would choose quality.
